# Sales Analysis and Reporting Tool

## Description

This tool is developed using Visual Basic to analyze sales data from two different stores - a 'Normal' store and a 'Bloomington' store. It provides insights on:

1. The day with the highest combined sales from both stores and the amount.
2. The average sales over different periods (first 10 days, next 10 days, and last 10 days) for the 'Normal' store.
3. The day with the least sales for the 'Bloomington' store and the amount.

The sales data is read from text files (`NormalSales.txt` and `BloomingtonSales.txt`) and the results are displayed in a user-friendly interface. This tool helps in quickly identifying the peak and low sales days, which can be useful for business owners or managers to make informed decisions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the final.sln file in a Visual Basic supported IDE (e.g., Microsoft Visual Studio).
3. Make sure you have the sales data text files (`NormalSales.txt` and `BloomingtonSales.txt`) in the project directory.

## Usage

1. Run the project.
2. Click on the 'Display output' button to get the results.
